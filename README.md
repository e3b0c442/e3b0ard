# e3b0ard

As the name suggests, e3b0ard is a keyboard I am building for myself. Strongly influenced by [corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) and [Ferris](https://github.com/pierrechevalier83/ferris), this board has the layout and features I consider to be important:

* Split design for relaxed posture and proper shoulder spacing while typing
* 3x5_3 layout to utilize [ZMK](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk) and [Miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku) to reduce reaching and wrist strain by effective utilization of layering
* Fully wireless using nice!nano and nice!view
* Low profile using Choc switches for maximum portability, hot swap sockets for maximum customizability
* No LEDs or other unnecessary electronics to achieve useful battery life with the smallest possible battery, further improving portability

## Work in progress

This project is a work in progress and likely will be for some time as I continue to refine and iterate on the design based on my experiences.
